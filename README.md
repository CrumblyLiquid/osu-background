# osu!background
 Tool for you to set your osu! main menu background

# Support
 Last I checked this works on version `20210316`

# Usage
1) Get full path of the image you want to use
2) Get the osu! path. It's usually `%appdata%/../Local/osu!` but yours might differ
3) Run the script (made in Python 3.8 but will probably work on older versions)
4) Start osu! and set `Options -> Main menu -> Seasonal backgrounds` to `Allways`
